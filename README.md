<h1> Customer Prediction Model on  </h1>

## 1. Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict customers who are likely to subscribe to a term deposit based on  their profile and past campaign data. This will enable  the marketing team to run targeted campaigns, improvisngconversion rates and reducing costs 

Key Objectives:
- Objective 1: Identify potensial customers 
- Objective 2: Shift from broad untargeted campaigns to data-driven targeted campaign 
- Objective 3: Reduce Marketing Cost
